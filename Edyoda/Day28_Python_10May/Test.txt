OOPS
Classes-Template/Blueprint of objects 
Objects-is created on the basis of 
objects
-anythng ahving properties,behaviour and
ID
properties,attributes,variables as well
behaviour,methods or functions
Class-Vehicle
attr-wheels,fuel,seater,name
behaviours--consumption of fuel
commuting, transportation
objects-sample objects auto,car,truck,bus,bike



Variables---instance and class
instance--sep copy for sep objects
class-single copy for sep objects--saving of 
space/memory

Ano, Name, Gender and Place--Instance
A1,A2,A3-- are 3 instances
org="UIDAI"--class variable

A1=Aadhar(103,"S",F,Kolkata)
A2=Aadhar(123,"Sagar",M,Noida)
A3=Aadhar(113,"Suraj",M,Delhi)


default--does not take any para
already present if no Para const

parametrized--it takes para(min1)
if para is present then have to
create def  construc seperately


self--points to the current instance


attributes,methods and constructors


Single Inheritence

Class-A-x,y,printx(self),printy(self)

Class B(A)--z,printz(self)

after inheritence

B-x,y,printx(self),printy(self),z,printz(self)

Syntax----class B(A):

Multiple Inheritence

Class-A-x,y,printx(self),printy(self)-4

Class B--z,printz(self)-2


Class C(A,B)--p,printp(self)-8
==C(2)+A(4)+B(2)==8


Multilevel Inheritence



Class-A-x,y,printx(self),printy(self)

Class B(A)--z,printz(self)-2

Class C(B)--p,printp(self)


Hirarchical Inheritence

Class-A-x,y,printx(self),printy(self)-4

Class B(A)--z,printz(self)-6

Class C(A)--p,printp(self)-6

#Polymorphism and Method Overriding---comes from Multiple Inheritence


#Method Overriding 

#when you try to redefine a method with same name but diff implementation
